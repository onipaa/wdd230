                        <p>Wilma Flintstone started Bountiful Foods in -4500 BC in an attempt to give health to her family. You can tell, her smoothies have had some effect, giving her a long life and pleanty of energy for a 6,523 year old beauty.

                        <p>Betty Rubble can never be considered Wilma's side kick. She is dyanmic, powerful, and full of spunk. What's more, she knows when to put Barney in his place, when he starts being a dunderhead. Betty and wilma both look great for being 6,520+ years old, proof that their Fresh and Healtful smoothes can breath new life into your person.</p>
