            <h1>Target Audience</h1>
            <p>This site has two targeted audiences, further illustrated by persona1 and persona2. The first is our local business owners. We want to generate support and local revenue. The second is the potential tourist or homeowner. By promoting this town as a friendly, safe, and great place to live and work, we attract future good citizens and potential business owners to our fair city of New Glasgow.</p>
            <h1>Persona 1</h1>
            <p>The first persona caters to business owners who can successfully add value to our town. These are citizens with entrepreneurial spirit and abilities.</p>
            <h1>Persona 2</h1>
            <p>Hopefully, the second persona caters to business owners and families who want to purchase or build homes in our city. The type of citizens we want are dedicated to the well-being of their neighbors and will positively add to our communities. We do not want people who are criminals or a danger to their neighbors.</p>
